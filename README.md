Instructions:
- Open TravelDocs application in Datacap Studio.
- Select and lock ruleset `ExportXML` for editing.
- Navigate to the action following the screenshot below.
- Update value of the action parameter on the right hand side to `@PILOT(BATCHDIR)`
- Save the changes and publish the ruleset.

## Usage

- Import the release twx file into Workflow Center
- Start process `ZTest Datacap Transaction`
- Run task `ZTest Datacap Transaction` and open the task screen
- Select one of the sample files already attached to the process instance or upload your file.
- Review the REST endpoint configuration and update it if needed.
- Select conversion from the proper UTF encoding. It may differ depending on on configuration of your Datacap.
- Click the button to call the transaction.

You can adjust the REST endpoint in CSHS `ZTest Datacap TravelDocs Cshs Coach`. Edit the script called `Init`.
